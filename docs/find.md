Find
====

Searches through one or more directory trees of a file system, locates files based on some user-specified criteria and applies an user-specified action on each matched file.

## Features
+ Will search the current working directory if no path is given.

## CLI vs JS function
+ When invoked as a javascript function, *find* will return an array of file objects instead of printing the filenames to stdout.
